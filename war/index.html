						<span>Both from small towns, we moved to the city to create our own lives. We met on the way out to a metal club, joined by his best friend and my sister. It turned out that the company was just too good not to find out where this might go.</span>
						<br>
						<br>
						<span>There was a connection that was unmistakable, that something special we where both looking for. Over the next couple of years we became best friends, sharing our lives, hopes and dreams.</span>
						<br>
						<br>
						<span>Then one sunset afternoon, on a cruise ship over a big lake, came that magical moment when he went down on one knee to ask "the BIG question". And the rest is not as they say history, but the beginning of a wonderful new life for us.</span>
						<br>
						<br>
						<span>"Meeting you was fate, becoming your friend was a choice, but falling in love with you was beyond my control" ..Anonymous</span>
						<br>
						<br>
						<span>We have found the person that does not just say I love you, but the person that means it every time. The person that we want to go to bed with every night and wake up next to every morning. This is our beginning, our start to something wonderful.</span>

						<span><strong>1 Corinthians 13</strong></span>
						<br>
						<span>
						4 Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. 
						5 It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. 
						6 Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. 
						7 It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. 
						8 Love never fails. But where there are prophecies, they will cease; where there are tongues, they will be stilled; where there is knowledge, it will pass away. 
						9 For we know in part and we prophesy in part, 
						10 but when perfection comes, the imperfect disappears. 
						11 When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I put childish ways behind me. 
						12 Now we see but a poor reflection as in a mirror; then we shall see face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known. 
						13 And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love.

						<span><strong>1 Thessalonians 5</strong></span>
						<br>
						<span>
						[16] Always rejoice. 
						[17] Pray without ceasing. 
						[18] In all things give thanks; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you all. 
						[19] Extinguish not the spirit. 
						[20] Despise not prophecies.
						[21] But prove all things; hold fast that which is good. 
						[22] From all appearance of evil refrain yourselves. 
						[23] And may the God of peace himself sanctify you in all things; that your whole spirit, and soul, and body, may be preserved blameless in the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
						[24] He is faithful who hath called you, who also will do it. 
						[25] Brethren, pray for us. 
						[26] Salute all the brethren with a holy kiss. 
						[27] I charge you by the Lord, that this epistle be read to all the holy brethren. 
						[28] The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.
